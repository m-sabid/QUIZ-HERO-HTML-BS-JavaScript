                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>map:</b> The map method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the
                    original array. It returns a new array of the same length as the original array with the result of
                    applying
                    the function to each element. It does not modify the original array.
                </p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>filter:</b> The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented
                    by the provided function. It returns a new array containing only the elements for which the function
                    returns true. It does not modify the original array.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>forEach:</b> The forEach method iterates over an array and executes a function for each element.
                    It does not create a new array and does not modify the original array.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>find:</b> The find method returns the value of the first element in an array that satisfies a
                    provided testing function. It returns undefined if no values satisfy the function. It does not
                    modify the
                    original array.

        <!-- Second question and answer -->
        <div class="mb-20 pb-5 border-b-[5px] rounded-lg">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Differences between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies:</h2>
            <div class="ml-10">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>LocalStorage:</b> localStorage is a type of web storage that allows you to store key/value pairs
                    in the browser with no expiration date. The data stored in localStorage persists even after the
                    browser window is closed and reopened. This makes it a good option for storing data that needs to be
                    accessed by the user even after they close and reopen the browser.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>SessionStorage:</b> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage in that it allows you to store
                    key/value pairs in the browser. However, data stored in sessionStorage only lasts for the duration
                    of the user's session, which means it is lost when the user closes the browser window or tab. This
                    makes sessionStorage a good option for storing temporary data that does not need to persist after
                    the user leaves the website.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>Cookies:</b> cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's computer by the browser.
                    Cookies can be used to store data such as user preferences or login information. Unlike localStorage
                    and sessionStorage, cookies can have an expiration date, which means they will be deleted after a
                    specified amount of time. Cookies can also be accessed by both the client-side and server-side code,
                    which makes them useful for maintaining state across multiple requests. However, cookies have a size
                    limit of 4KB and are less secure than localStorage and sessionStorage because they can be
                    intercepted or manipulated by third parties.

        <!-- Third question and answer -->
        <div class="mb-20 pb-5 border-b-[5px] rounded-lg">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">How does the event loop work in JavaScript?</h2>
            <div class="ml-10">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>Event Loop:</b> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback
                    Queue.
                    If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
                    to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

            <div class="ml-10">
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>quizTimer:</b> The quizTimer function is a JavaScript function that creates a timer to be used in
                    a quiz. It takes a boolean argument called dismiss, which when set to true, clears the timer and
                    stops the countdown.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <b>chooseQuiz:</b> The chooseQuiz function is a JavaScript function that allows the user to select
                    or
                    choose a quiz and record their answer. It takes two arguments, the index of the selected quiz and
                    the user's answer to that quiz.
